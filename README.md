### Introduction

One of the most common tasks for front-end and junior developers is to take existing code and refactor it to either meet a certain set of standards or implement a new technology. Web accessibility is an increasingly important consideration for businesses, ensuring that people with disabilities or socio-economic restrictions have access to their website, and helping them avoid litigation.

The task is to refactor an existing webpage to make it accessible. An important rule to follow when working with someone else's code is the Scout Rule:

Always leave the code you are editing a little cleaner than you found it.

### Requirements

1. Ensure that all links are functioning correctly and clean up the CSS to make it more efficient
2. Consolidate CSS selectors and properties, organizing them to follow the semantic structure of the HTML elements
3. Include comments before each element or section of the page when needed
4. Submit URL of the deployed application and include a README
